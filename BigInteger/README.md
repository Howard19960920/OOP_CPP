# BigInteger
C++ Class practice - Big Integer

Class bigInt can do the basic calculations with long digits number that even long long can't hold.

+: let the number with longer digits (if exists) be the top operand, which is the same way as human calculating.

-: let the number with longer digits (if exists) be the top operand, which is the same way as human calculating.

*: let the number with longer digits (if exists) be the top operand, this can decrease times to go in and out the loops.

/: Use decimal approximation, this is the algorithm I think up my own, tho there might already exist some similar reference.

As for the details about other operator overloaded info, such as '=', '-', GT, GE, LT, LE, etc, please refer the implementation files.
