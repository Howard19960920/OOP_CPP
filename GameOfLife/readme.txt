This is the second homework of the OOP class: Game of Life in C++.


Here are some points you should know before compiling the code:

  1. The OS I work on is Ubuntu 16.04 64bits.
  2. The program use the system call of "clear", which clean the terminal in Ubuntu. So if you are on a windows system, the program can't execute normally.
  3. The program use the function call of  "usleep", which take a usecond as a input in Ubuntu. So if you are on a windows system, the program might not be able to run as expected.

Steps to follow:

  1. type 'make' on the terminal to execute the makefile.
  2. the act above will produce a execution file in the current directory with the name 'GameOfLife'
  3. type './GameOfLife' to execute the file.
  4. When executing the execution file, the program will first demo each of the four prototype(glider, light-weight spaceship, pulsar, and random) one after one in a evolution in 100 generation.
  5. Once the demo is done, you could input any other testing data as you want.
  6. Then the program should exit normally with the process of evolution to the corresponded input correctly if there's nothing wrong.

Thanks for your reading!
